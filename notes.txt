This will be a Django app:
    1. set up django
    2. install dependencies
    3. create directory structure

How the app will work:
    1. take url as input from a html form:
    2. run the url through a function to see if the url is shortened
    3. find where the url is being redirected to.
    4. serve the expanded url to a function to look up the who is registry
    5. see if the url is registered to the company it is claiming to be
    6. return whether or not it is a match,
    7. if not prompt the user to report it by completing a form which sends an email to phishing related email address
       for the company in question.
